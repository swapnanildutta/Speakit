## Why people need this?

In the modern workplace, you need more than technical skills to be successful in your career. Todayâ€™s employers seek candidates who can perform their jobs well but who can also fit into the company culture and interact with other employees. In order to do these things successfully, students need to develop soft skills. 

Soft skills are attributes that enable you to engage in meaningful interactions with others. Since most jobs require teamwork, itâ€™s important to possess soft skills to enhance your employability and achieve your dream job.
