## Why people need this?

In the modern workplace, you need more than technical skills to be successful in your career. Todayâ€™s employers seek candidates who can perform their jobs well but who can also fit into the company culture and interact with other employees. In order to do these things successfully, students need to develop soft skills. 

Soft skills are attributes that enable you to engage in meaningful interactions with others. Since most jobs require teamwork, itâ€™s important to possess soft skills to enhance your employability and achieve your dream job.

## Language barriers in present day

A lack of appropriate communication through education or familiarity of language can lead to common traps and/or mistakes that many of us make. Examples of these mistakes may include misinterpreting a facial/body gesture, words or phrases that may carry different meanings in another language or culture. Educating professionals on the pitfalls of language barriers should contribute to ensuring that the needs of clients are being met on different levels. More efforts have been made over the past few years in regards to utilizing language interpreters within more community organizations. 

Language is the most powerful tool of communication. Its function includes the: communication of ideas, thoughts, opinion and emotional expression, social interaction, using the power of sound, g recording facts, expression of identity. However, at the same time, a common barrier to effective communication. Language or semantic barriers arise when many words have more than one meaning, and a sender and a receiver try to communicate in a language, which themselves do not understand properly. So, communication is not always successful. There may be some faults or obstacles in the communication system, which may prevent the message from reaching the intended receiver or its destination. Language barriers are generally arising in five areas: the way a message is originated and sent by a sender, environmental interruptions, and the way it is received and understood by a receiver. Language barriers are significant because they are often an impediment to building relationships with others. They can cause misunderstandings that lead to conflict, frustration, offense, violence, hurt feelings, and wasting time, effort, money, and lives of the people.

Effective communication is important in the workplace as it presents the opportunity to gain a better understanding of others. The key to communication is to listen to learn instead of being quick to respond. These strategies enable leaders to achieve more proactive problem solving and project a positive influence over their workers.

Effective communication is an attractive trait that is highly coveted by employers. As you are able to communicate well, you are also portraying a positive and professional image, helping you to pave your career paths better and more successfully.

## How we are trying to minimize language barriers

In this project, we are trying to help people learn other languages and accents in a fun and interactive way. Suppose you have a days visit Germany, so instead of going deep into German, you could just learn how to pronounce and make sentences so that you can express your thoughts to the person in front of you.
